## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently following a COBOL cours at Simplon (Lille) to refresh my Cobol knowledge and catch up with the latest working methods and developping platforms such as Git/Github.

Having a solid Mainframe background due to my expertise in z/TPF, an operating system that runs on the Mainframe, moving towards COBOL is my best choice to rejoin the Mainframe community.
